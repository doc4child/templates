# App Templates

This repository hosts combination of templates from official repository as well as several others and some of my own templates

For more information about the template definition format and how to deploy your own templates, see the [relevant documentation section](https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/templates/deploy_stack/).


# Portainer App Templates for LinuxServer.io Docker containers

These [Portainer App Templates](https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/settings/apps/) can be used to easily deploy [LinuxServer.io Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/linuxserver/) with predefined settings.

I have modified original templates to reflect the updated timezone, users of 1000 and group of 1000 for Ubuntuserver

The templates are based on data provided by the [LinuxServer.io GitHub repositories](https://github.com/linuxserver).

Please keep the following in mind.
* The templates are not supported by LinuxServer.io
* The templates are being generated so I cannot accept requests to add templates
